Personal Portfolio Website using HTML and CSS.

This is my personal portfolio project showcasing my skills and work as a Content Writer. The portfolio is built using HTML and CSS and includes responsive design to ensure optimal viewing experience across devices. The portfolio features my About info, Services, projects, testimonials and contact information. The clean and modern design of the portfolio is intended to highlight my abilities as a front-end developer and create a positive impression on potential employers or clients.
